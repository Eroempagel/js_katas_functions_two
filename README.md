# js_katas_functions_two
A kata is an individual exercise where you practice a programming skill through repetition.
Today you will practice using JavaScript loops and functions.
These katas start out trivial and ramp up in difficulty.
The primary goals of this collection of katas are:  

To get you accustomed to writing and calling functions which accept arguments (input values) and return results. 
To get you accustomed to breaking down a problem into the various parts of a FOR loop. 
You will use the return keyword for the output of your function. 
Unlike other katas we've done up until now, most of these build on each other, 
which means that you will need to complete them in order.  
Note that anything I say below about functions also applies to methods (we'll talk about the difference soon).
